<p>The process for creating animations is rather complex. However, the basic description of this would be: "to create frame by frame images that play back in order".</p>
<p>I think I will make a circle that changes into a square while rotating and vise-versa.</p>
<p>I will create one function for rotation, one for the circle and square, and the last for the transition between the two shapes. I will create these fuctions to ensure ultimate world domination.</p>
