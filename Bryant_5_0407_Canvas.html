<p>I have learned a lot about canvas and how to program it, but three specific things that I learned was how to start and stop paths, how to make random generators, and for loops.
 To begin a draw path, one must first use the code: ctx.beginPath(); then to finish it, use this: ctx.end();. Making random generators is actually pretty difficult. 
First, you must have variables or a compelling alternitive to make this. Then, you make the random generator: Math.floor((Math.random() * 4) + 0);. Finally, "for" loops; these 
are an efficientcy code. Instead of making individual glazed donuts, for loops will make a millin before you can say lickety-split. An example of this can be found within my 
own mind: for (i=0; i(less than)100; i++) { System.out.println("Hello"); }.</p>
