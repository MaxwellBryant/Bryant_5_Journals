	<p><b>1.</b> The challenges that I faced when creating the website was the CSS formatting. I am also very picky so I felt I had to make the page perfect.</p>
	<p><b>2.</b> The problem that I have solved primarily was the position for the main section of text. I also solved the problem of repeating images.</p>
	<p><b>3.</b> I have learned a great array of things including how to style an a:hover, how to center a section, and how to stop repeated images.</p>
