	<h1>Journal</h1>
 <p>I felt that I was very successful building the website, but I couldn't finish it. :(((</p>
 <p>I made some great color improvements, I edited the java script a bit, I gave borders to each section, and I typed a lot more.</p>
 <p>I solved positioning problems like when you would open a new page with more text, the aside would cover some parts, so I gave it a margin so 
it can adjust accordingly.</p>
