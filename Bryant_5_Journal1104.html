 <p>A parent would most likely compared to an html page; specifically, the father. A mother would most likely be the css, commanding the html to shape-up or ship-out. 
A sibling would represent a class or an id tag; they are aportion of the family that makes the pieces whole.</p>
 <p>I would plan to primarily create the webpage with a single class, "container". I would have to make the class absolute, so it wouldn't move. I also plan to move everything 
by using percentages over pixels.</p>
