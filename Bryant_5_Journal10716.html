	<h1>Journal</h1>
 <p>We are re-doing this large website because we need to practice these things so we can truely learn.</p>
 <p>I will change all of the colors with A TON of changes to the text format. Before, it was quite boring, now it really stands out to you. 
I also gave all of the sections borders to make them pop and more interesting.</p>
