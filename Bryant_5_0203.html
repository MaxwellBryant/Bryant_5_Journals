 <p>I accomplished stuff in JavaScript by revising the window alerts and adding something cool of my own. If the person pressed 'cancel' on any of the windows, it would pull up another one saying 'YOU SHALL NOT SEE THE WEBSITE'. After this, the window would close and you couldn't see the content of the website.</p>
