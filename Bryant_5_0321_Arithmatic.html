 <p>1. I believe algorithmic art is the art you can create with math. For instance, to position a line, you would use math to make the correct coordinates for the line.</p>
 <p>2. You can make perplexing, yet OCD free art with algorithmic art. That is what makes it all so cool.</p>
 <p>3. The benefits of algorithmic art is learning or gaining a better understanding of the algorithims themselves. Being able to calculate visually is a key skill to the improvement process.</p>
