 <p>An array is a list of items in a program. Since computers are weird, they start counting from zero in these lists, so when you call them, start with zero.</p>
 <p>You can use an array list and a random function to create mad libs! All we do is call them correctly, and they will randomly be used throught the entire array.</p>
