			<p>1. A document object model (DOM) is a programming interface that is to be made like a logical flow chart. For example, in this website, the first thing you always do is declare the document type, which is HTML. Then you declare head, body, and even a footer. You wouldn't put your feet where your head should be, right?</p>
			<p>2. DOM is important for web design so that you can reference to the page in code much faster than an unorganized interface. This also allows the computer to find important things easier without having errors.</p>
			<p>3. This is also EXTREMELY important for JavaScript because of how it works. You want to declare variables before you want to have the user answer them. For example, var Donut = false; document.write("Would you like a Donut?"); if (answer == "yes") { Donut = true; }.</p>
