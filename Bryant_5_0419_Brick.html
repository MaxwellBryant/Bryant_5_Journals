<p>I believe the difference between the two groups consists within interaction. The group that didn't get things done were talking about useless things. What needed to be talked about was inspiration, or better yet, the CODE! Staying on task is a big issue in this web design class. When did nerds have a social life? Anyway, The main difference between the two was interaction.</p>
