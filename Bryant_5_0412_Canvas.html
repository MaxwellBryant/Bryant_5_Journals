 <p>The process for creating animations in Canvas is almost entirely made by you. This program is a low-level program which means that you have to do a lot to get a little done. However, Canvas is not a shalf bad as Assembly is; in Assembly, you truly have to do EVERYTHING. Anyway, you first want to make a canvas, then you can draw shapes with algorithmic equations.</p>
 <p>I planned on creating a circle that transitioned into a square, but since I am making this up, I know what I did. I basically tinkered with the rotation and the radius resizing and made something cool.</p>
 <p>I primarily created a "for" loop for making america great again. Then, I modified two other functions.</p>
